# Lets-build-a-transistor-computer

In 1975 my dream was to build a computer of discrete transistors. However, transistors were costly then (about 1$ or 1 Euro each). Now I'm retired and the cost of components is no longer an issue. So I set out to build a very simple transistor CPU, following the Modified Harvard architecture. On YouTube I placed a series of videos describing the building process in the channel "Let's build a transistor Computer". In this repository you'll find helpfull files.
